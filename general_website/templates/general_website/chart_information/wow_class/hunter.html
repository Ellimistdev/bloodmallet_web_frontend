        Hunter Theorycrafters determined having profiles in SimulationCraft and therefore profiles being used on/by
        bloodmallet.com front-page causes more harm than good. Therefore they removed their profiles and don't intend to
        re-add them.

    <p>
        bloodmallet.com should provide helpful information. Therefore if spec/class theorycrafters decide information
        shown on the front-page here is misleading and absolutely bad, the data is rather deleted than publish.

    <p>
        The intention for bloodmallet.com is to be helpful. Not an annoyance.

        Custom charts for <a href="/faq#how-to-generate-a-personal-chart">Patrons (FAQ)</a> can continue to get
        generated for Hunter characters. You need to provide your own character information ("/simc") to generate a
        chart specific to your character and your selected fight style.
