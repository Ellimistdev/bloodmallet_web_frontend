        SimulationCraft has currently <a target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/tree/thewarwithin/profiles/TWW1">no Hunter profiles</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/pull/9731">an attempt</a> was made to update them, this
        wasn't merged yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once profiles are back, I'm happy to generate Hunter data again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile custom charts for <a href="/faq#how-to-generate-a-personal-chart">Patrons (FAQ)</a> can continue to
        get generated for Hunter characters.

    <p>
        I apologize about the previous misrepresentation of the situation. I didn't properly understand for/about who
        exactly the past statements were made. The above information is now updated accordingly.
